<h1>Parc Clematis</h1>

<p><strong>Parc Clematis</strong> is a large-scale residential condominium development located along Jalan Lempeng in the Clementi area of Singapore. Developed by SingHaiyi Group, this project is well-known for its resort-style facilities, extensive landscaping, and strategic location within the western region.</p>

<h2>Location & Surroundings</h2>
<p>Parc Clematis is situated in District 5, a mature estate with a strong mix of residential, educational, and commercial amenities. The development is close to established neighbourhoods such as Clementi, Dover, and West Coast, making it appealing to families and working professionals.</p>

<p>Nearby amenities include Clementi Mall, West Coast Plaza, and various neighbourhood shops and eateries. Daily necessities, supermarkets, and food options are easily accessible.</p>

<h2>Connectivity & Accessibility</h2>
<p>The development enjoys good connectivity via major roads such as the Ayer Rajah Expressway (AYE) and Clementi Road. Clementi MRT Station (East-West Line) is a short drive or bus ride away, providing direct rail access to the city centre and Jurong East.</p>

<p>Public transport options are readily available, with several bus services serving the surrounding area.</p>

<h2>Facilities & Lifestyle</h2>
<p>Parc Clematis is designed as a full-fledged lifestyle development with a wide range of facilities. These include multiple swimming pools, clubhouses, fitness areas, tennis courts, children’s play zones, and landscaped gardens.</p>

<p>The layout emphasises greenery and open spaces, offering residents a resort-like living environment within an urban setting.</p>

<h2>Nearby Schools & Education</h2>
<p>The condo is located near several reputable schools and institutions. Popular choices include Clementi Primary School, Nan Hua Primary School, and tertiary institutions such as the National University of Singapore (NUS) and Singapore Polytechnic.</p>

<p>This proximity makes Parc Clematis particularly attractive to families with school-going children.</p>

<h2>Investment Considerations</h2>
<p>From an investment perspective, Parc Clematis benefits from strong rental demand due to its proximity to business hubs, educational institutions, and the one-north area. The western region continues to see long-term growth supported by developments in Jurong Lake District.</p>

<p>Its large unit mix and comprehensive facilities appeal to both owner-occupiers and tenants.</p>

<h2>Who Is Parc Clematis Suitable For?</h2>
<p>Parc Clematis is suitable for families seeking a full-facility condominium, professionals working in the west, and investors looking for a property with stable rental potential.</p>

<p>The combination of location, amenities, and lifestyle features makes it one of the notable residential developments in Clementi.</p>
