<h1>Parc Clematis</h1>

<p>
Parc Clematis is a large, recently completed (2023), 99-year leasehold private residential development located in the Clementi area of District 5, Singapore. Developed by SingHaiyi Group, the project comprises a total of 1,468 residential units spread across nine 24-storey towers, along with two rows of strata-landed houses within the development.
</p>

<h2>Location & Surroundings</h2>

<p>
Parc Clematis is situated along Jalan Lempeng in Clementi, a well-established residential town in Singapore’s west. The surrounding area is primarily made up of mature housing estates, schools, and neighbourhood amenities, providing residents with a balanced living environment that combines convenience and tranquillity.
</p>

<p>
The development benefits from proximity to Clementi Town Centre, where residents can access supermarkets, retail shops, food options, banks, and essential services. Major commercial and business nodes such as one-north, Buona Vista, and Jurong Lake District are also within reasonable commuting distance.
</p>

<h2>Connectivity & Accessibility</h2>

Parc Clematis enjoys strong transport connectivity. Clementi MRT station (East-West Line) is located nearby, offering direct rail access to key areas such as Buona Vista, Raffles Place, and Jurong East. Several bus services also serve the area, enhancing last-mile connectivity for daily commuting.
</p>

<p>
For drivers, the development is well-connected via major expressways including the Ayer Rajah Expressway (AYE) and Pan Island Expressway (PIE), allowing convenient travel to the city centre, western business hubs, and other parts of Singapore.
</p>

<h2>Development Overview</h2>

Designed as a comprehensive residential enclave, Parc Clematis features a mix of high-rise apartment blocks and strata-landed homes. The wide range of unit types caters to different household profiles, from singles and couples to larger families.
</p>

The layout emphasises greenery, open spaces, and internal amenities, creating a self-contained living environment for residents. Building orientation and spacing are planned to optimise ventilation, privacy, and views within the estate.
</p>

<h2>Facilities & Lifestyle</h2>

</p>

<h2>Investment & Living Considerations</h2>

As a large-scale, modern development in a mature estate, Parc Clematis appeals to both owner-occupiers and investors. Its proximity to educational institutions, transport nodes, and employment centres contributes to its rental and long-term value potential.
