<h1>Core Trade</h1>

<h2>What Core Trade Means</h2>
<p>
Core trade means the main type of work a company does.
It is the skill or service the business focuses on.
This term is common in Singapore construction and contracting.
It helps people understand what a company is best at.
</p>

<h2>Core Trade in the Singapore Construction Industry</h2>
<p>
In construction, core trade refers to the main trade carried out.
It can be electrical, plumbing, or fire protection work.
Companies usually register and bid jobs based on their core trade.
This helps keep work quality and safety standards.
</p>

<h2>Why Core Trade Is Important</h2>
<p>
Core trade shows the real strength of a contractor.
It tells clients what kind of jobs the company should handle.
It also affects licensing, insurance, and worker skills.
Choosing the right core trade avoids poor workmanship.
</p>

<h2>Core Trade Versus Secondary Work</h2>
<p>
Core trade is the main business activity.
Secondary work is support or additional services.
For example, an electrical contractor may also do minor wiring support.
But electrical work remains the core trade.
</p>

<h2>How Companies Define Their Core Trade</h2>

But the original core trade usually remains the main focus.
