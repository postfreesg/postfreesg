  <h2>Overview of Property Agent Commission in Singapore</h2>
  <p>Property agent commission in Singapore refers to the fee paid to real estate agents for completing a successful property transaction. These fees apply to buying, selling, and renting homes and vary depending on property type, transaction complexity, and service level.</p>
  <p>Commission rates are not fixed by law, but there are common market standards that most agents follow. Homeowners and tenants can negotiate fees based on their needs, marketing scope, and agent experience.</p>

  <h2>Typical Property Agent Commission Rates</h2>
  <p>Below are the most common commission rates for different transaction types in Singapore:</p>

  <h3>1. Selling Property (HDB & Private)</h3>

    <li><strong>HDB resale:</strong> 1%–2% of selling price (paid by seller)</li>
    <li><strong>Condo or landed:</strong> 1%–2% of selling price (paid by seller)</li>
    <li>Buyer usually does not pay commission unless a private arrangement exists.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>2. Buying Property</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Most buyers do not pay commission.</li>
    <li>Some agents offer buyer-side services with a small negotiable fee.</li>
    <li>Private property purchases rarely involve buyer-paid commission.</li>

  <h3>3. Renting Property (Landlord & Tenant Commission)</h3>
  <p>Commission depends on the length of the lease and monthly rental amount:</p>

    <li><strong>Half-month commission:</strong> For 1-year leases.</li>
    <li><strong>Tenant commission:</strong> Usually payable when tenant engages their own agent.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Who Pays the Property Agent Commission?</h2>
  <p>Commission obligations typically follow these guidelines:</p>

  <h3>For Selling</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Sellers pay their agent (seller’s agent).</li>
    <li>Buyers do not pay commission unless they specifically engage a buyer’s agent.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>For Renting</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Landlords pay their agent if the agent primarily serves the landlord.</li>
    <li>Tenants pay their agent if they engaged the agent to represent them.</li>
    <li>In some cases, agents co-broke and share commission from one party.</li>
  </ul>
