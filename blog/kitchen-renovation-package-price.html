  <ul>
    <li>Costs are often higher due to premium appliances and materials.</li>

  <ul>
    <li>Identify your cooking frequency and storage requirements.</li>
    <li>Compare package inclusions from at least three renovation firms.</li>
    <li>Check material specifications—not all carpentry and quartz are equal.</li>
    <li>Request 3D drawings to visualise the final look.</li>
    <li>Clarify warranty terms for carpentry, hinges, and counters.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Tips to Save on Your Kitchen Renovation</h2>
