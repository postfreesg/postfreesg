<h1>The Florence Residences</h1>

<p><strong>The Florence Residences</strong> is a large-scale private condominium located along Hougang Avenue 2 in District 19, Singapore. Developed by Logan Property (Singapore), the project sits on the former Florence Regency HUDC site and has become one of the most talked-about suburban launches due to its resort-style facilities, extensive landscaping, and relatively accessible pricing for a full condominium.</p>

<h2>Location & Surroundings</h2>
<p>The Florence Residences is situated in a low-rise residential enclave within Hougang. The surrounding area is primarily made up of established HDB estates, schools, and neighbourhood amenities, giving the development a strong family-oriented environment.</p>
<p>Residents benefit from proximity to everyday conveniences such as Hougang Mall, Heartland Mall, wet markets, coffee shops, and clinics. Several schools are located nearby, including Hougang Primary School, Holy Innocents’ High School, and Montfort Secondary School.</p>

<h2>Connectivity & Accessibility</h2>
<p>While The Florence Residences is not directly next to an MRT station, it is within a manageable distance to Hougang MRT (North East Line). Shuttle bus services have been provided to improve first-mile and last-mile connectivity, making daily commuting more convenient.</p>
<p>For drivers, the development enjoys good road connectivity via Upper Serangoon Road, Kallang–Paya Lebar Expressway (KPE), and Central Expressway (CTE), offering relatively smooth access to the city and other parts of Singapore.</p>

<h2>Project Overview</h2>
<p>The Florence Residences is a large development comprising over 1,400 residential units spread across multiple blocks. The project is known for its low-rise, resort-inspired layout with generous spacing between blocks, extensive greenery, and communal spaces.</p>
<p>Unit types range from compact one-bedroom apartments to larger family-sized units, catering to a broad spectrum of buyers including singles, couples, and multi-generational families.</p>

<h2>Facilities & Lifestyle</h2>
<p>One of the key highlights of The Florence Residences is its wide range of facilities. The project features multiple swimming pools, clubhouse spaces, fitness corners, jogging paths, and landscaped gardens. The design focuses heavily on lifestyle living rather than just functional housing.</p>
<p>There are also dedicated family-friendly zones such as playgrounds, BBQ pavilions, and relaxation decks, making it appealing for buyers with children or those who value community living.</p>

<h2>Prices & Value Proposition</h2>
<p>Prices at The Florence Residences have generally been positioned competitively compared to newer launches in similar suburban locations. This has made it attractive to both owner-occupiers and investors looking for long-term capital appreciation.</p>
<p>The large land size, full suite of facilities, and relatively lower entry price (compared to city-fringe developments) contribute to its strong value proposition within District 19.</p>

<h2>Who Is It Suitable For?</h2>
<p>The Florence Residences is well-suited for families seeking a full condominium lifestyle in a mature heartland area. It also appeals to upgrader buyers moving from HDBs who prioritise space, facilities, and a quieter living environment.</p>
<p>Investors may find the development appealing due to its large tenant pool potential from nearby schools, businesses, and the overall affordability compared to city-centre condos.</p>

<h2>Final Thoughts</h2>
<p>The Florence Residences stands out as a lifestyle-focused suburban condominium offering extensive facilities, a family-friendly environment, and reasonable pricing. While MRT proximity may not be its strongest point, the overall living experience, scale, and amenities help balance this limitation.</p>
<p>For buyers looking for a long-term home or a stable suburban investment, The Florence Residences remains a development worth considering.</p>
