<h1>High Park Residences Singapore – Complete Property Guide</h1>

<p><strong>High Park Residences</strong> is a large-scale condominium development located in the Fernvale area of Sengkang. Known for its generous land size and family-oriented layout, the project appeals mainly to owner-occupiers looking for space, facilities, and long-term liveability rather than short-term speculation.</p>

<h2>Location & Surroundings</h2>
<p>High Park Residences is situated along Fernvale Road, within District 28. The development sits in a quieter residential enclave, surrounded by schools, neighbourhood parks, and low-rise housing. While it is not located in a central or prime district, it offers a calm living environment away from dense city traffic.</p>

<h2>Connectivity & Accessibility</h2>
<p>The nearest LRT stations include Thanggam and Fernvale, which connect residents to Sengkang MRT Interchange. From there, commuters can access the North-East Line and Sengkang Bus Interchange. For drivers, access to major roads such as Tampines Expressway (TPE) and Seletar Expressway (SLE) makes travelling to other parts of Singapore relatively convenient.</p>

<h2>Nearby Amenities</h2>
<p>Residents benefit from nearby neighbourhood malls such as Seletar Mall and Compass One. Daily necessities, supermarkets, food options, and essential services are all easily accessible. Educational institutions in the vicinity include Nan Chiau Primary School, Pei Hwa Secondary School, and several childcare centres.</p>

<h2>Development Overview</h2>
<p>High Park Residences is a 99-year leasehold condominium comprising over 1,300 residential units across multiple blocks. Unit types range from compact one-bedroom layouts to larger four-bedroom and dual-key units, making the development suitable for singles, couples, and multi-generation families.</p>

<h2>Facilities & Lifestyle</h2>
<p>The development offers a wide range of facilities, including multiple swimming pools, tennis courts, fitness corners, function rooms, and landscaped gardens. The large land size allows for more open spaces and recreational areas, which is a key attraction for families with children.</p>

<h2>Pricing & Market Position</h2>
<p>Compared to developments in mature estates, High Park Residences is generally priced more affordably on a per-square-foot basis. Prices tend to reflect its suburban location, leasehold status, and large unit supply. For buyers focused on space and own-stay value rather than aggressive capital appreciation, the pricing can be attractive.</p>

<h2>Rental Demand</h2>
<p>Rental demand comes mainly from families and professionals working in the north-eastern and northern regions of Singapore. While rental yields may not be the highest, the development’s size and facilities help maintain steady occupancy.</p>

<h2>Who Is High Park Residences Suitable For?</h2>
<ul>
<li>Families looking for larger living spaces</li>
<li>Buyers prioritising facilities and environment over central location</li>
<li>Long-term owner-occupiers rather than short-term investors</li>
<li>Buyers seeking suburban affordability</li>
</ul>

<h2>Key Takeaways</h2>
<p>High Park Residences stands out for its scale, family-friendly design, and comprehensive facilities. While it may not suit buyers seeking city-fringe convenience or rapid capital gains, it remains a solid option for those prioritising space, lifestyle amenities, and long-term liveability in the Sengkang area.</p>
