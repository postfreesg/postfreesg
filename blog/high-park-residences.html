<h1>High Park Residences</h1>

<p>High Park Residences is a large private condominium located along Fernvale Road in Sengkang. It sits in District 28 and is well known for its scale, greenery, and family friendly layout. The development was completed in stages and offers a wide range of unit types, from compact one bedroom units to larger family homes.</p>

<h2>Location and surroundings</h2>

<p>The project is set within a low density residential area near Seletar and Jalan Kayu. The surroundings are mostly private housing, parks, and schools. This gives the area a quieter feel compared to mature town centres.</p>

<p>Residents are close to amenities in Fernvale and Sengkang, including neighbourhood shops, coffee shops, and childcare centres. Jalan Kayu, known for its supper spots and cafes, is also a short drive away.</p>

<h2>Transport and connectivity</h2>

<p>High Park Residences is served by Fernvale LRT station, which connects to Sengkang MRT station on the North East Line. From there, residents can travel towards the city or other parts of Singapore with ease.</p>

<p>For drivers, the development has access to Tampines Expressway (TPE), Central Expressway (CTE), and Seletar Expressway (SLE). These routes make daily travel to places like Ang Mo Kio, Punggol, and the city centre more manageable.</p>

<h2>Development scale and layout</h2>

<p>One of the defining features of High Park Residences is its size. The project consists of multiple residential blocks with a large internal compound. Facilities are spread across the site, giving many units views of greenery, pools, or open spaces.</p>

<p>The layout is designed to separate living areas from heavier traffic roads where possible. Internal walkways and landscaped areas create a more relaxed environment for residents.</p>

<h2>Facilities and shared spaces</h2>

<p>The condominium offers a full range of facilities typical of a large development. These include swimming pools, gym areas, function rooms, BBQ pits, and play spaces for children. There are also quieter corners for reading or light exercise.</p>

<p>Because of the size of the development, facilities are distributed across different zones. This helps reduce crowding and gives residents more options depending on where they live within the project.</p>

<h2>Unit types and living suitability</h2>

<p>High Park Residences provides a broad mix of unit sizes. Smaller units may appeal to singles or couples who want a private home near the Sengkang area. Larger units suit families who need more space and value nearby schools and parks.</p>

<p>Most units come with practical layouts, with a focus on usable living areas rather than long corridors. Higher floor units may enjoy more open views towards landed housing or greenery.</p>

<h2>Schools and family appeal</h2>

<p>The Sengkang and Fernvale area is known for having several schools within reasonable distance. This makes High Park Residences attractive to families with young children.</p>

<p>Parks, cycling paths, and playgrounds in the wider Sengkang area also support an active lifestyle. Many families appreciate the balance between urban living and access to outdoor spaces.</p>

<h2>Daily living experience</h2>

<p>Living at High Park Residences offers a quieter pace compared to central city developments. Daily needs can be met within the neighbourhood, while larger malls and town centres are accessible via public transport or a short drive.</p>

<p>The development suits residents who value space, greenery, and a more relaxed environment, while still staying connected to the rest of Singapore.</p>
